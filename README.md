# Election-Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to assist Tom at the Board of Electors in determining the winner of a US congressional precinct in Colarado. We were tasked with determining the total votes, votes for each candidate, percentage of votes for each candidate, the winner (based on simple majority), voter turnout for each county, percentage of vote from each county, and the county with the highest turnout. 

## Election-Audit Results

Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

* How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

* Which county had the largest number of votes?

* Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.

* Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
